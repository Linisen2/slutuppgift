                <h3>Terms of Service:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are not to use my artwork for <strong>ANY</strong> merchandise at all, that <strong>includes</strong> non-profit merch, without my express permission!</li>
                    <li>I ask that you credit me when using my artwork on any platform by either placing a panel I offer you in your twitch panels, a command, or honestly any other way. Just something that lets your viewers know the original artist for the artwork. If you are truly against it, I get it, but I ask that you consider the time and effort I put into working on your pieces. </li>
                    <li>Any commissioned artworks are for <strong>your</strong> personal use only. The files are <strong>not</strong> to be distributed or given to anyone without my permission, that includes other graphic artists for panels, overlays, etc. </li>
                    <li>I maintain all rights to use any artwork I make, that includes commissions, meaning that I may use it for my own personal uses, however I will <strong>never</strong> resell any piece commissioned from me whatsoever. You have my guarantee!</li>
                    <li>My work is not to be distributed, copied, or altered in <strong>ANY</strong> way without my permission! </li>
                    <li>If you bully/rush me and/or are overall rude, disrespectful, or break the terms I will turn down/terminate the commission. I work very hard and I am only human so I need time to wind down. I can't work 24/7.</li>
                    <li>If you commission me this means that you agree to <strong>all</strong> of my terms and conditions and will follow them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Payment:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payment is made through PayPal. You will receive and invoice through PayPal. If you do not have a PayPal account please let me before hand as I will send you a link to the invoice.</li>
                    <li>At least half of the payment is due before hand as a deposit on all works (excluding sketches) done so once the details are worked through about what you'd like I will walk you through how to pay and your total.</li>
                    <li>All major changes to the emote/sketch ideas have to be done in the sketching phase, once I begin to finalize the pieces I will only allow minor changes or fees to cover major ones and the redraw.</li>
                    <li>Prices are <strong>NON-NEGOTIABLE</strong> and I will not be bullied into lowering them. I work incredibly hard to deliver quality art and I feel that my prices are very fair for my experience and background. </li>
                    <li>Payments are <strong>NONREFUNDABLE</strong> once I start working on your commission. If you cancel the commission before I start finalizing you will recieve a 50% refund. Once I complete the commission there will be NO refunds! This is non-negotiable so please be sure you can afford the commission before the commission starts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What I Won't Draw:</h3>
